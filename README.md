# To-Do List Flutter Application

Welcome to my first Flutter application! This app is a straightforward to-do list that allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks to their list with a simple interface.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks once they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Check off tasks as you complete them, keeping track of your progress throughout the day.
- **Database Implementation** Tasks that user adds will persist throughout sessions
- **Reminders and Notifications** User can set reminders and receive notifications when it's time to complete their task
- **Dark Mode**
